This is a very common UI component: a modal window. There are three buttons that display the modal window when they get clicked. The user can close it in three different ways:

- by clicking on the close button
- by clicking on the overlay
- by pressing the ESC key

All of this is accomplished by adding and removing the class **hidden**, which sets the display property of an element to none.
